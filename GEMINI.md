# Workspace Instructions

- This repository is The Tutor Lyfe downstream site, built from the `anderson-webops/vitesse-nuxt-template` monorepo.
- Keep `origin` pointed at `anderson-webops/thetutorlyfe.com` and `upstream` pointed at
  `anderson-webops/vitesse-nuxt-template`. Review the template's own `antfu/vitesse-nuxt` lineage there rather than
  configuring this downstream site directly against it.
- Maintain the root npm workspace pattern with exactly two primary workspaces: `front-end` and `back-end`.
- Use Node 24.18.1 with npm 12.0.2 and validate site changes with `npm run audit:all`, `npm run audit:prod`,
  `npm run validate`, and `npm run a11y` before pushing.
- Keep `package-lock.json` up to date whenever dependencies or workspace manifests change.
- Keep `back-end/package-lock.json` in parity with the backend manifest because the direct API runtime uses it for its
  production-only install.
- Do not leave completed site work uncommitted or unpushed.
- Preserve the Docker-free direct Nginx/systemd and Netlify adapters so every production path deploys the Express
  backend instead of silently discarding it.
- Keep contact submissions same-origin at `POST /api/leads`. Configure the destination only through the server-side
  `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL`; never expose it in the Nuxt bundle or commit it.
- The previous Google Apps Script backend, source project, and ownership access were not included in the site takeover.
  Do not assume control of the URL found in the captured browser source.

## Dependency & Lockfile Discipline

- Treat the repo-root `npm ci` path as the source of truth for deploy readiness.
- Any time `package.json`, any workspace `package.json`, dependency ranges, `package-lock.json`, or dependency update tooling changes, verify lockfile parity from the repo root before committing.
- Do not rely on `npm install` fallback as success. A change is not deploy-ready unless root `npm ci` succeeds.

Required production/dev dependency update flow before every dependency commit:
1. Check production and development dependency freshness from the repository root with `npm outdated --workspaces --long` or the repo's documented equivalent.
2. Review both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in the root and every workspace package; do not limit updates to production-only packages.
3. Apply needed updates with the narrowest command that updates the relevant manifest and lockfile together, such as `npm install -w <workspace> <package>@<version>` or `npm install -D -w <workspace> <package>@<version>`.
4. If the update is only a lockfile/security refresh, regenerate from the root with `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --no-fund --no-audit`.
5. Run `npm audit` from the repository root and resolve remaining production or dev advisories before committing unless a documented upstream limitation prevents it.

Required dependency verification before every commit/push:
1. Run `npm ci` from the repository root.
2. Run `npm run lint`.
3. Run `npm run typecheck`.
4. Run `npm run build`.
5. If API or back-end behavior changed and the repo has a back-end workspace, run `npm run -w back-end test` or the repo's equivalent API test command.

If `npm ci` fails because `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are out of sync:
1. Run `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --no-fund --no-audit` from the repository root.
2. Re-run `npm ci` from the repository root.
3. Commit the resulting `package-lock.json` change with the related dependency/package change.

Never commit or push dependency/package changes if root `npm ci` fails.
